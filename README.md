# Doorway

## Early Phonics

Just a repository to publish the demo of the web application being developed for Doorway Accessible Software by University of Glasgow students.

[GitHub Pages Demo](https://jawadmahmoud.github.io/Early-Phonics)

This repo only contains the build version of the application and used to deploy to GitHub Pages for user testing and evaluation. The development version exists on a private repository so that development files may not be accessed by public.
